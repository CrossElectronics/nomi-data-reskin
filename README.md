# nomi-data-reskin
Retexture of a few data in [Nomifactory CEu edition](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu)

In the game, my understanding of these data are that these are "data sets", as apposed to "data models" in DML/DME. I want to add a medium for those data to make them look more like an item.
It's my first time making resourcepack, or any pixel art, really. Feel free to use and/or contribute.

## Previews

> Do note that GIF previews can show some flickering that's not in the game. This is probably due to quality loss during the conversion.

**Impossible realm data**: Possibly the easiest data to obtain, therefore a floppy shows how basic it is.

**Stellar creation data**: It's the first data an HM player will get, therefore a floppy shows how basic it is.

**Dragon lair data**: From T4.5 MM, it has larger data capacity than before, I'll use a USB stick
</br><img src="./preview/dragon-lair.gif" width="25%" height="25%">

**Wither realm data**: Also from T4.5 MM, USB stick it is
</br><img src="./preview/wither-realm.gif" width="25%" height="25%">

**Lair of The Chaos Guardian**: Late game stuff, HDD is one of the most compact mass storage we can easily obtain.

**Universe Creation Data**: End game stuff, probably needs larger storage option but I'm out of ideas
